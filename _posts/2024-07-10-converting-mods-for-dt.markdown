With Penumbra test version released yesterday, you can use mods  through it again, but if you will try to import mod that was made before Dawntrail release you might find it all weird and broken, thats cause Penumbra does **not** convert them automatially for Dawntrail :c But fear not, cause TexTools does! 

If you are into modding, you might want to [convert your entire penumbra mod folder](#converting-your-entire-penumbra-mod-folder)!

## Converting one modpack

This is only convert working mods like gear so test penumbra can use it, it will **not** fix really broken mods like sculpts!

If you dont have TexTools installed yet, then [get it here](https://www.ffxiv-textools.net/)! 

Then, click this

Done!

## Converting your entire Penumbra mod folder

If you are not that much into modding, i sugest not doing that and just wait until penumbra will be able to do that automatically for you :>
