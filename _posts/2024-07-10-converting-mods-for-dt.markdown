With Penumbra test version released yesterday, you can use mods  through it again, but if you will try to import mod that was made before Dawntrail release you might find it all weird and broken, thats cause Penumbra does **not** convert them automatially for Dawntrail :c But fear not, cause TexTools does! 

> If you are getting error while upgrading modpack, [see this](#an-error-occured-while-upgrading-modpack)!

## Converting one modpack

This is only convert working mods like gear so test penumbra can use it, it will **not** fix really broken mods like sculpts!

If you dont have TexTools installed yet, then [get it here](https://www.ffxiv-textools.net/)! 

Then, click this

  	<figcaption>
		do it
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Done! If you are getting error, [see this](#an-error-occured-while-upgrading-modpack)!

## Converting your entire Penumbra mod folder

If you are not that much into modding, i sugest not doing that and just wait until penumbra will be able to do that automatically for you :>

## An error occured while upgrading modpack

If you are getting error that asks you isntalling modpack with desired options then create modpack from TexTools, do that!

  	<figcaption>
		do as it says :>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

To do so fast, open TexTools, make sure it is in says SAFE at the top right, then begin a transaction!

  	<figcaption>
		after making sure it says SAFE, begin transaction
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Then, install the mod as usual and click transaction button again :> You will see a list of files appears there! Select format by clicking "Transaction Target", a path to save by the button below and then hit COMMIT TRANSACTION. Done!
