Had you ever experienced getting nice female only dress that screwing up textures on same gear item for males? Or invisible on other races? I did, and there is ~~author laziness~~ a reason for that. 

<details>
  <summary> Why does it happen? </summary>
  <p> Cause metadata affect all variants of item, for all races and genders, but modded item usually repacing only tall female or male model. Like lets say you downloaded fancy one-piece swimsuit, so it should hide your bottoms (with hands and feets sill in place), but there is not that much vanilla items that fit the description. There is always workarounds, but all of them will make same item for other races work different! </p>

# Mod breaks item for other races/genders

There is a way for you to get rid of weird stuff that comes with mods! There are Collections tab in penumbra, that let you choose which mods apply to which characters!

So, just set collection you are using for yourself to apply to "Your Character" or "Currect Character" (by name). If you want some mods like bodies apply to everyone you can create new collection on the left and set put it to use on the right!

To set, which mods enabled/disabled in which collection, go to the "Mods" Tab and choose collection on the top right corner, then enable the ones you want to be enabled in this collection :>

It's also nice for perfomance to have only mods you really want apply to other characters, cause many mods have a lot of polygons or high resolution textures that could be bad for perfomance when there are a lot of characters wear different mods on screen :>
