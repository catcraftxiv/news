Step by step guide ho to toggle variant parts through Penumbra :> By doing so you can toggle and combine options as you wish!

[Go to video guide (1 min)](#video-guide) 

## Step by Step Guide

To open toggle menu, open mod in penumbra window, then click on "Advanced Editing" tab and go to "Meta manipulatons" tab in new opened window!

There you should see a window like on screenshot below! We need "Variant Edits (IMC)" section there, but, probavly, you will see that it says "0" at the start and yellow text at the right, like there.
That means, that currently selected option at top right corner does **not** have anything edited, but yellow text says, that other options do have!

We need to select correct option from dropdown 
list at the top right corner, where it now says "Default Option". Usually, it will have same name as you had ticked yourself in modpack settings! In this case, select any of quick toggles you want to edit :>

After selecting option that does have variant part edited, you will see a number appear before at "Variant Edits (IMC)" section, that means there it is! Now, open that section and use checkboxes at the right :>

After you did some changes, dont forget to click "Apply Changes" to save changes button in Advanced Editing window, and then "Redraw Self" button in Penumbra main window to refresh your character!

The changes will stay in option you had edited forever :>
