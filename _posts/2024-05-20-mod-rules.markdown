Rules is very simple :> in short, feel free to edit **free** (which you can download for free without sub or payment) stuff for personal use or post it for **free** and do **not** sell our work and edits of it please!

I can't include every single case into cool-looking list, so please if you not sure use common sense or just ask me at discord :>

## if you making something for personal use:
- edit any mod for personal use as you wish

## if you about to post your edit *anywhere*:

- any edits of **free** releases is okay as long as **your mod free**
- **link** original mod
- do not use our stuff for your **paid** mods
- do not use our **paid** (including sub) stuff for your mods
- do not port in other games

Feel free to use #modding-help channel on our [discord] :> I will be glad to help you with anything i know!
