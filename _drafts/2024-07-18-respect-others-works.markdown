You wont find anything new there, just use common sense and dont disrepect other's works. 

<br>
People put a lot of time in their creations and deserve being treated fair for it. You wont be happy if you will work hard a lot of hours and then someone will say "nah i think you should work for free" and will start redistributing your creations, being thanked for their generosity and blaming you for your greed, wont you? 

## Do not blame all authors for deeds of ones

Yes, you might have seen people who are selling things they havent made, stating like that is their own creations. Maybe some paid hair ports from Shining Nikki, or clothing from another game. Sometimes people try to hide that with fancy words, like strange abbreviations for game name  is it from that no one uses. Or not mentioning that at all. The author page might contain some life drama to try to justify their deeds. 

That is indeed neither legally nor morally correct, **but that does not mean you can act same in return.** Please, do not act nor persuade others to act bad because other people deeds. It is never late for accepting mistakes and change for better.

**The modding itself is violation game's Terms of Service, so there are no clear line between white and black. Please, try to respect other's time they had put in it. If you are not agree with them, do not use their works.** Try to be honest with each other and accept that they might have different opinion.

[Catcraft community](https://discord.gg/yPbUXazxQ3) is welcome for everyone! If you are not agree with someone, no one asks to. Just not cause a conflict please:>

## Do not justify bad deeds

Treat others fair. For Cactraft, the purpose of creating is for share it with others and see their joy using it. But to keep creating, people need to live and pay their bills. We should try to make each other lives a little better if we have power to do so. 

If you really want something, but cant afford it, ask for it. If you really want to use something you are not allowed to use, explain everything and ask about it. There is always a space for understanding and help each other.
